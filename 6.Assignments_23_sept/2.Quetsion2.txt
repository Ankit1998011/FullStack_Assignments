BEM stands for Block, Element, Modifier and is a naming convention used in web development to create clear and 
modular CSS styles.

In BEM, each component or element on a webpage is given a unique class name based on its purpose and function.

Block: The top-level component or standalone element that represents a distinct section of the webpage. It is 
usually a meaningful and descriptive name, written in lowercase and separated by hyphens (e.g., "header", 
"sidebar", "button").

Element: A part of the block that has no standalone meaning and is semantically tied to the block. It is 
represented by the block's class name followed by two underscores and a descriptive name (e.g., "header__logo", 
"button__text").

Modifier: An additional state or variation of the block or element. It is represented by the block or 
element's class name followed by two dashes and a descriptive name (e.g., "button--disabled", 
"header__logo--small").

The BEM naming convention helps in creating self-explanatory and reusable CSS classes, making it easier to 
understand and maintain code in larger projects with multiple developers.
