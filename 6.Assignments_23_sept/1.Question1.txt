When you target the same element with inline, internal, and external CSS, the CSS rules will be applied based 
on their specificity and the order in which they are declared.

Inline CSS: Inline CSS is applied directly to an HTML element using the style attribute. It has the highest 
specificity and will override any other CSS rules targeting the same element. Inline CSS is considered a bad 
practice because it mixes presentation with content, making the code harder to maintain.

Internal CSS: Internal CSS is defined within the HTML document using the <style> tag inside the <head> section. 
It has a higher specificity than external CSS but lower than inline CSS. If you target the same element with 
both internal and external CSS, the internal CSS rules will take precedence over the external CSS.

External CSS: External CSS is defined in a separate CSS file and linked to the HTML document using the <link> 
tag. It has the lowest specificity among the three. When targeting the same element with external and internal 
CSS, the internal CSS rules will override the external CSS rules.

In summary, inline CSS will always take precedence over internal and external CSS, while internal CSS will 
override external CSS. It is generally recommended to use external CSS for better maintainability and 
separation of concerns.
