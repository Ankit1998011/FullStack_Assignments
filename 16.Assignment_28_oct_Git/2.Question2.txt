Q2. Explain the Git Workflow, including the staging area, working directory, and repository.

Ans

"Git Workflow", which involves three core areas: the "Working Directory", the "Staging Area" (also known as the "Index"), 
and the "Local Repository". These components play crucial roles in managing changes to your codebase:

1. "Working Directory":
   - The "Working Directory" is where you actively work on your files. It's the directory on your local machine where you create, 
     edit, and modify files.
   - When you make changes to files in your working directory (such as adding new code or modifying existing code), Git tracks 
     these changes.

2. "Staging Area (Index)":
   - The "Staging Area" acts as an intermediary step between your working directory and the local repository.
   - After making changes in your working directory that you want to commit, you "add" these changes to the staging area.
   - The staging area takes a "snapshot" of the changes, preparing them for a commit.
   - Think of it as a place where you assemble the changes you want to include in your next commit.

3. "Local Repository":
   - The "Local Repository" is where Git stores the complete history of your project.
   - When you're ready to permanently save your changes, you "commit" the changes that have been added to your staging area.
   - A commit creates a new snapshot of your project, including all the changes made since the last commit.
   - The local repository maintains a record of all commits, allowing you to revisit previous versions of your code.

In summary:
- "Working Directory": Where you actively work on files.
- "Staging Area": An intermediate step to prepare changes for commit.
- "Local Repository": Stores the complete history of your project.
