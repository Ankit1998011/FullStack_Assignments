Q1. Explain what version control is and its importance in software development.

Ans.

1. "Definition":
   - "Version control systems (VCS)" are software tools that track and manage changes made to files in a codebase.
   - They maintain a record of modifications, including who made them and what changes were implemented.

2. "Importance of Version Control":
   - "Collaboration": In collaborative software development, where multiple developers contribute from different locations,
      VCS enables efficient communication and change tracking.

   - "Efficient Code Management": VCS keeps the source code organized by creating separate branches for contributors.
      Changes are analyzed and merged into the main codebase.

   - "Productivity Boost": By providing better communication and assistance, VCS enhances productivity and expedites product delivery.

   - "Error Reduction": Traceability to every small change minimizes errors and conflicts during project development.

   - "Geographical Flexibility": Contributors can work from anywhere, overcoming geographical barriers.

   - "Disaster Recovery": VCS helps recover from contingencies by preserving historical versions.

   - "Accountability": It informs us about who, what, when, and why changes were made.

3. "Popular Examples":
   - "Git": A widely used distributed VCS.
   - "Helix Core": Suitable for large-scale projects.
   - "Microsoft TFS": Integrated with Visual Studio.

In summary, version control ensures efficient collaboration, reduces errors, and provides a safety net for software development.
