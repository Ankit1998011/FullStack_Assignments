Ans.  Some important features of HTML are:-

1.Structure: HTML provides a way to structure the content of a webpage using various elements such as headings,
paragraphs, lists, tables, and more.

2.Text formatting: HTML allows you to format text by specifying attributes such as bold, italic, underline, 
and strikethrough.

3.Hyperlinks: HTML enables the creation of hyperlinks, allowing users to navigate between webpages by clicking 
on a specific text or image.

4.Images and multimedia: You can embed images, videos, audio, and other multimedia content into an HTML 
document.

5.Forms: HTML provides form elements to create interactive forms, such as text fields, checkboxes, radio 
buttons, dropdown menus, and submit buttons to collect user input.

6.Semantic elements: HTML introduced semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, 
<footer>, etc., which add meaning to the structure of a webpage.

7.Tables: HTML allows you to create tables to organize and present data in rows and columns.

8.Lists: HTML supports ordered lists (<ol>), unordered lists (<ul>), and definition lists (<dl>) to display 
information in a list format.

9.Metadata: HTML includes elements like <title>, <meta>, and <link> to provide metadata about the webpage, 
such as its title, description, author, and stylesheet.

10.Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) integration: HTML can be combined with CSS to style and enhance the appearance 
of webpages.

11.Accessibility: HTML supports accessibility features like alternative text for images (alt attribute), 
semantic elements for screen readers, and ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes.

12.Responsive design: HTML allows the creation of responsive webpages that can adapt and display properly on 
different devices and screen sizes.

13.Audio and video support: HTML5 introduced <audio> and <video> elements, allowing the direct embedding of 
audio and video content without the need for third-party plugins.
