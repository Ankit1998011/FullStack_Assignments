Here are three ways to improve the accessibility of HTML:

1.Proper Use of Semantic HTML: Using semantic HTML elements such as headings (h1-h6), paragraphs (p), 
lists (ul, ol), and others helps provide structure and context to web content. It allows assistive technologies 
to understand the hierarchy and relationships between different parts of the content, making it easier for 
people with disabilities to navigate and comprehend.

2.Alternative Text for Images: Providing descriptive alternative text (alt text) for images ensures that users 
with visual impairments can understand the meaning and context of the images. Alt text should be concise, yet 
provide enough information to convey the purpose of the image. This allows screen readers to read out the alt 
text to users who cannot see the images.

3.Keyboard Accessibility: Ensuring that all interactive elements on a webpage can be easily accessed and operated 
using only a keyboard is critical for users with mobility impairments or those who cannot use a mouse. This 
includes providing keyboard focus indication, allowing easy navigation through tab and arrow keys, and making 
sure that all functionality can be accessed and triggered using a keyboard alone.

These are just a few examples of how HTML can be improved for accessibility. Other considerations include using 
high color contrast for text and background, providing clear and concise link text, and ensuring that multimedia 
content has captions or transcripts available. Implementing these practices can greatly enhance the accessibility 
of HTML and make websites more inclusive for all users.
