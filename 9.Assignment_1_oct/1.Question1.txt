CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid Layout are both powerful layout models in CSS that allow developers to create complex 
and responsive web page layouts. However, there are some key differences between the two:

1.Purpose: Flexbox is primarily designed for one-dimensional layouts, allowing you to arrange elements in a row 
or a column. It is best suited for building components within a layout. On the other hand, Grid Layout is a 
two-dimensional layout model, enabling you to create grid-based layouts with rows and columns. It is better 
suited for designing overall page layouts.

2.Axis: Flexbox has a main axis and a cross axis. You can define whether the items in the flex container are 
arranged in a row or a column based on the main axis. Grid Layout, on the other hand, has both row and column 
axes, allowing for more complex layouts.

3.Alignment: Flexbox provides powerful alignment properties, such as align-items and justify-content, which 
allow you to align items along the main and cross axes. Grid Layout offers similar alignment properties, but 
with more control due to its two-dimensional nature.

4.Nesting: Flexbox works well with nested elements, allowing you to create more complex components within a 
layout. Grid Layout also supports nesting, but it provides more control over the placement of child elements 
within the grid.

5.Browser support: Flexbox has good support across modern browsers, including IE 11. Grid Layout, on the other 
hand, has better support in newer browsers and lacks support in older versions of IE.

In summary, Flexbox is ideal for arranging components within a layout and handling one-dimensional layouts, 
while Grid Layout is more suited for overall page layout and supports complex two-dimensional layouts. Both 
models have their own strengths and can be used together for more advanced layout requirements.
