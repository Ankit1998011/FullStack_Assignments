Q3. Differentiate between unary, binary, and ternary operators in JavaScript. Give examples of each.

Ans.

Let's explore the different types of operators in JavaScript and provide examples for each category:

1. "Unary Operators":
   - Unary operators require "one operand" for operation.
   - They operate on a single value or variable.
   - Examples:
     - "`typeof` Operator": Returns the data type of a value. For instance:
       
       ```javascript

       typeof "hello"; // Returns "string"
       
       ```

2. "Binary Operators":
   - Binary operators require "two operands" for operation.
   - They perform operations between two values or variables.
   - Examples:
     - "Addition (`+`)": Adds two numbers:
       
       ```javascript

       10 + 20; // Returns 30
       
       ```

3. "Ternary Operator":
   - The ternary operator is a special operator that requires "three operands".
   - It provides a concise way to write conditional expressions.
   - Syntax: `condition ? expression1 : expression2`
   - Example:

     ```javascript
    
     const score = 80;
     const scoreRating = score > 70 ? "Excellent" : "Do better";
     console.log(scoreRating); // "Excellent"
    
     ```
