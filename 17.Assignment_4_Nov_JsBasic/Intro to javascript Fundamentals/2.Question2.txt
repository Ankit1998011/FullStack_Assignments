Question 2: Explain the key differences between JavaScript and HTML. Provide examples of situations where
you would use each.

Ans.

JavaScript and HTML are both essential components of web development, but they serve different purposes and have different capabilities. Here are the key differences between the two:

1. "Purpose": 

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used for creating the structure and content of web pages. It defines the elements of 
a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. 

JavaScript, on the other hand, is used for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.

2. "Syntax": 

HTML uses tags to define elements, such as `<p>` for paragraphs and `<img>` for images. 

JavaScript uses a syntax that is more  similar to traditional programming languages, with statements, variables, functions, and loops.

3. "Execution": 

HTML is static and is interpreted by the browser to display content on a web page.

JavaScript is dynamic and can be executed in the browser to manipulate the content of a web page in real-time.

4. "Example Usage":

- "HTML": You would use HTML to create the structure of a web page, such as defining headings, paragraphs, lists, and links. 
          For example, to create a simple webpage with a heading and a paragraph of text.


- "JavaScript": You would use JavaScript to add interactivity to a web page, such as responding to user actions or updating
   content dynamically. For example, you could use JavaScript to create a button that changes the text of a paragraph when clicked.
