Question 3: List and describe the five primitive data types in JavaScript.


Ans. 

In JavaScript, there are five main primitive data types:

1. "Number": This represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
   

2. "String": This represents a sequence of characters, enclosed in single ('') or double ("") quotes.

3. "Boolean": This represents a logical value, either `true` or `false`.

4. "Null": This represents an intentional absence of any value. It is a primitive value and not an object.
   

5. "Undefined": This represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value.


There are also some other primitive data types like "Symbol" and "BigInt" which were mentioned in class but are not as important.
These primitive data types are immutable, which means their values cannot be changed.
