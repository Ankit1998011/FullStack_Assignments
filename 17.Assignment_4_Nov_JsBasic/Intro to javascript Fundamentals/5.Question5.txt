Question 5: Explain the importance of comments in JavaScript and provide examples of single-line and
multi-line comments.

Ans.

Comments in JavaScript are used to add explanatory notes or annotations to your code. They are ignored by the JavaScript engine 
and are not executed, making them useful for documenting your code, explaining complex parts, or temporarily disabling code for 
debugging purposes.

Here are examples of single-line and multi-line comments in JavaScript:

- Single-line comment:
  
  // This is a single-line comment


- Multi-line comment:

  /*
  This is a
  multi-line comment
  */
  

Comments are important because they make your code more readable and maintainable. They provide insights into the logic behind the
code, making it easier for other developers (or your future self) to understand how the code works. 
Additionally, comments can help you remember why certain decisions were made or what needs to be improved in the code.
