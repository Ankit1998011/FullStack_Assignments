Question 1: Explain what JavaScript is and its role in web development.

Ans.

JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language that is used to make websites interactive. 
It is one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS. JavaScript allows developers to add complex features 
to websites, such as interactivity, animations, and dynamic content updates, without the need to reload the entire page.

In web development, JavaScript is primarily used for client-side programming, which means it runs in the user's web browser rather 
than on the web server. This allows for a more responsive and dynamic user experience, as JavaScript can manipulate the content of
a web page in real-time based on user actions, such as clicking a button or filling out a form.

JavaScript is also increasingly used for server-side programming, thanks to platforms like Node.js. This allows developers to use 
JavaScript to build both the client and server sides of web applications, making it easier to maintain and scale web projects.

Overall, JavaScript plays a crucial role in modern web development, enabling developers to create rich, interactive web experiences 
that were not possible with just HTML and CSS alone.
