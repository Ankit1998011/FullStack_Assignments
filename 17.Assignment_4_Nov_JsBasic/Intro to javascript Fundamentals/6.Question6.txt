Question 6: Explain the importance of choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript.
Provide an example where using a clear identifier improves code readability.

Ans.

Choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript is important because it makes your code easier to understand and
maintain. When variable names are clear and descriptive, it becomes easier for other developers (or your future self) to quickly 
grasp the purpose of the variable and how it is used in the code. This can lead to faster debugging, easier refactoring, and overall
better code quality.

Here's an example where using a clear identifier improves code readability:


// Not so clear variable name
let x = 10;
let y = 20;
let z = x + y;

// Clearer variable names
let width = 10;
let height = 20;
let area = width * height;


In the first example, using single-letter variable names like "x", "y", and "z" makes it difficult to understand what these variables
represent and how they are related. In the second example, using descriptive variable names like "width", "height", and "area" makes 
it clear that "width" and "height" are dimensions, and "area" is calculated based on these dimensions. This improves the readability 
and maintainability of the code.
