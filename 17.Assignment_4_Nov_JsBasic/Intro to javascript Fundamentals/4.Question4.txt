Question 4: What is the purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript, and how do you declare them using the
'let' keyword?

Ans.

Declaring variables in JavaScript allows you to store and manipulate data in your programs. Variables are used to hold values that
can change during the execution of a program. They also provide a way to give meaningful names to these values, making your code more
readable and maintainable.

In JavaScript, you can declare variables using the `let` keyword. Here's how you do it:

```javascript

let variableName;

```

You can also initialize a variable with a value at the time of declaration:

```javascript

let age = 30;

```

When you declare a variable using `let`, the variable is block-scoped, which means it is only accessible within the block of code 
where it is declared. Block scope refers to any code within curly braces `{}`.
