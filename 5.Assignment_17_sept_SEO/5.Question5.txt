A favicon, short for "favorite icon," is a small icon that represents a website or webpage. It appears in 
various places, such as browser tabs, bookmarks, and bookmark bars, providing visual branding and aiding in 
easy identification of a website. Favicon files are generally in .ico format, although other image formats 
such as .png or .svg can also be used.
