        <p>A favicon, short for "favorite icon," is a small icon that represents a website or webpage. It appears in 
            various places, such as browser tabs, bookmarks, and bookmark bars, providing visual branding and aiding in 
            easy identification of a website. Favicon files are generally in .ico format, although other image formats 
            such as .png or .svg can also be used.</p>
