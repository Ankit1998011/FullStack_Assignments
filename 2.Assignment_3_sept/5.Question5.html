        <dd>JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for adding interactivity and functionality to web pages. It is often referred to as the "language of the web" because it is widely supported by web browsers and allows developers to create dynamic and interactive web applications.</dd>
        <br>
        <dt><u>Node.js</u>:</dt>
        <dd>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It enables server-side scripting and allows for the creation of dynamic web applications and APIs.</dd>

        <dt><u>MongoDB</u>:</dt>
        <dd>MongoDB is a popular open-source, document-oriented NoSQL database. It provides a flexible and scalable approach to storing and managing data, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB does not use tables with fixed schemas. Instead, it stores data in flexible and self-contained JSON-like documents called BSON (Binary JSON) documents.</dd>

        <dt><u>React.js</u>:</dt>
        <dd>ReactJS, or simply React, is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces (UIs).
