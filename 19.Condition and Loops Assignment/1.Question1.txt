Q1. What are conditional statements? Explain conditional statements with syntax and examples.

Ans.

In JavaScript, conditional statements are used to execute different code based on different conditions. There are mainly three types 
of conditional statements: "if", "else if", and "else".

1. "if" statement: It executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.

   Syntax:
   
   if (condition) {
       // code to be executed if the condition is true
   }
   

   Example:
   
   let age = 18;
   if (age >= 18) {
       console.log("You are an adult.");
   }
   

2. "else if" statement: It executes a block of code if the same condition is false and another condition is true.

   Syntax:
   
   if (condition1) {
       // code to be executed if condition1 is true
   } else if (condition2) {
       // code to be executed if condition2 is true
   }


   Example:

   let score = 75;
   if (score >= 90) {
       console.log("A Grade");
   } else if (score >= 80) {
       console.log("B Grade");
   } else if (score >= 70) {
       console.log("C Grade");
   }


3. "else" statement: It executes a block of code if the preceding conditions are false.

   Syntax:

   if (condition) {
       // code to be executed if the condition is true
   } else {
       // code to be executed if the condition is false
   }
   

   Example:

   let hour = 15;
   if (hour < 18) {
       console.log("Good day!");
   } else {
       console.log("Good evening!");
   }


These conditional statements can be nested to create more complex conditions and behaviors.
