Q3. What are loops, and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and
examples.

Ans.

Loops in JavaScript are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true. They are essential for
performing repetitive tasks efficiently.

There are several types of loops in JavaScript:

1. "for" loop: It repeats a block of code a specified number of times.

   Syntax:
   
   for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
       // code to be executed
   }
   

   Example:
   
   for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
       console.log("Iteration " + i);
   }


2. "while" loop: It repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

   Syntax:
   
   while (condition) {
       // code to be executed
   }


   Example:
   
   let i = 0;
   while (i < 5) {
       console.log("Iteration " + i);
       i++;
   }


3. "do...while" loop: It is similar to the "while" loop, but the code block is executed once before checking the condition.

   Syntax:
   
   do {
       // code to be executed
   } while (condition);
   

   Example:
   
   let i = 0;
   do {
       console.log("Iteration " + i);
       i++;
   } while (i < 5);
   

4. "for...in" loop: It iterates over the enumerable properties of an object.

   Syntax:
   
   for (variable in object) {
       // code to be executed
   }
   

   Example:
   
   const person = {
       name: "John",
       age: 30,
       gender: "male"
   };
   for (let key in person) {
       console.log(key + ": " + person[key]);
   }
   

5. "for...of" loop: It iterates over the iterable objects like arrays, strings, etc.

   Syntax:

   for (variable of iterable) {
       // code to be executed
   }
   

   Example:
   
   const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
   for (let fruit of fruits) {
       console.log(fruit);
   }


Each type of loop has its use cases and can be selected based on the specific requirements of the task at hand.
