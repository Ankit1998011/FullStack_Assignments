In HTML, a tag is a keyword surrounded by angle brackets (<>) that defines an HTML element.
HTML elements are the building blocks of a webpage, and they define the structure and content of the page.

An HTML element consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag. The start tag marks the beginning of the 
element, and the end tag marks the end. The content between the start and end tags represents the actual 
information or components that will be displayed on the webpage.

For example, consider the following HTML element:

<h1>Welcome to my webpage!</h1>

In this example, <h1> is the start tag, Welcome to my webpage! is the content, and </h1> is the end tag. 
This element represents a heading level 1 (h1) on the webpage, and the text "Welcome to my webpage!" 
will be displayed as a large heading.

HTML tags and elements are used to structure the webpage, define headings, paragraphs, links, images, 
tables, forms, and more. They allow developers to organize and present content in a meaningful way that can 
be understood and rendered by web browsers.
