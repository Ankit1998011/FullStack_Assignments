Absolute positioning in CSS allows you to precisely specify the exact position of an element relative to its 
closest positioned ancestor or to the document itself. When an element is absolutely positioned, it is taken 
out of the normal document flow, meaning other elements will not be affected by its position. The element is 
placed using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. Absolute positioning is often used to create 
overlays, tooltips, or fixed elements on a webpage.

On the other hand, relative positioning in CSS allows you to position an element relative to its normal 
position in the document flow. When an element is relatively positioned, it still takes up space in the 
document flow and other elements are affected by its position. The element is moved using the offset 
properties: top, bottom, left, and right. The position of the element is relative to its original position, so 
it can be shifted in any direction. Relative positioning is often used when you want to slightly adjust the 
position of an element without affecting the layout of other elements.
